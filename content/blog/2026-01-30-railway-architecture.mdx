# Building a Multi-Project Portfolio with Railway

Today I'm tackling an interesting architectural challenge: building a portfolio website that seamlessly hosts multiple independent projects.

## The Vision

I want **sonpham.net** to serve as a central hub with:

- Main portfolio and blog
- Individual project deployments (ARC Creator, Wealth of Agents)
- Each project running independently
- Unified navigation experience

## The Architecture

Railway makes this surprisingly elegant with subdomain routing:

```
sonpham.net → Main portfolio
arc.sonpham.net → ARC Creator  
agents.sonpham.net → Wealth of Agents
```

### Why This Works

Each project:
- Lives in its own GitHub repository
- Deploys as a separate Railway service
- Scales independently
- Maintains its own CI/CD pipeline

## The Alternative: Monorepo

I considered a monorepo with tools like Turborepo, but decided against it because:

- Projects have different tech stacks
- Independent deployment cycles are valuable
- Easier to open-source individual projects
- Better separation of concerns

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Railway project** with multiple services
2. **Configure DNS** at domain registrar
3. **Deploy each service** from its GitHub repo
4. **Link custom domains** in Railway
5. **Test and iterate**

## What I Learned

Railway's multi-service architecture is perfect for this use case. The ability to connect different repos to different services while maintaining a unified domain structure is exactly what I needed.
